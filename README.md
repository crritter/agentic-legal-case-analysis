# Agentic Legal Case Treatment Analysis
***Christopher Ritter***

## Project Description
This project presents a sophisticated agentic AI system designed for legal discovery applications. Leveraging Casetext's internal API, OpenAI's LLM ecosystem, LangChain for agent coordination, and LangGraph for workflow orchestration, this system creates a multi-agent architecture to identify the presence or absence of negative treatment of legal cases referenced within legal opinions.

The system employs specialized AI agents that collaborate to perform complex legal reasoning, making it suitable for production-scale legal discovery workflows. The primary function, `extract_negative_treatments_agentic`, takes a `SLUG` (Casetext's proprietary case identifier) as input and returns a comprehensive structured analysis of case treatments.

## Key Features

### Multi-Agent Architecture
- **CaseExtractionAgent**: Specialized in identifying and validating legal citations using both LLM analysis and regex pattern matching
- **TreatmentAnalysisAgent**: Expert in analyzing legal language to determine negative treatment with confidence scoring
- **Workflow Orchestration**: LangGraph coordinates agent collaboration with conditional logic based on confidence thresholds
- **Quality Control**: Automated assessment with human review flagging for complex cases

### Robust Output Structure
If case references are found, the system produces a structured `AnalysisResult` containing:
- **Case name and citation** as they appear in the opinion
- **Negative treatment determination** (boolean with confidence score)
- **Treatment types** (overruled, reversed, criticized, distinguished, etc.)
- **Relevant excerpts** containing every mention of the case
- **Detailed explanations** with professional analysis and uncertainty acknowledgment
- **Processing metadata** including confidence scores and human review flags

If no case references are found, the system returns a clear message: `"No cases found in this opinion."`

## Building the Agentic System

The agentic architecture addresses several critical challenges in legal AI applications through specialized agent collaboration:

### 1. Agent Specialization and Tool Integration
Rather than asking one LLM to perform all tasks, the system employs specialized agents:

```python
class CaseExtractionAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm):
        self.tools = [
            Tool(
                name="extract_citations",
                description="Extract legal case citations using pattern matching",
                func=self._extract_citations_pattern
            ),
            Tool(
                name="validate_citation_format", 
                description="Validate if a citation follows proper legal format",
                func=self._validate_citation_format
            )
        ]
```

Each agent can use domain-specific tools, enabling more accurate and reliable analysis than generic prompting approaches.

### 2. Dynamic Workflow Management with LangGraph
The system uses LangGraph to create conditional workflows that adapt based on analysis confidence:

```python
self.workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "quality_check",
    self.should_review,
    {
        "human_review": "finalize_results",
        "complete": "finalize_results"
    }
)
```

This enables the system to automatically escalate uncertain cases for human review while processing high-confidence determinations automatically.

### 3. Robust JSON Parsing and Error Recovery
A critical component of the system is comprehensive error handling:

```python
class JSONParser:
    @staticmethod
    def safe_parse_json(text: str, expected_structure: str = "object"):
        # Strategy 1: Direct JSON parsing
        # Strategy 2: Extract from markdown code blocks
        # Strategy 3: Find JSON-like structures in text
        # Strategy 4: Graceful fallbacks
```

This multi-strategy approach handles the reality that LLMs don't always produce perfect JSON, significantly improving system reliability.

### 4. Confidence-Based Decision Making
The agentic system provides confidence scores and reasoning for all determinations:

```python
case_treatment = CaseTreatment(
    case_name=case_data["case_name"],
    negative_treatment=treatment_analysis["negative_treatment"], 
    confidence_score=treatment_analysis["confidence"],
    explanation=treatment_analysis["explanation"],
    requires_human_review=confidence < 0.9
)
```

This enables appropriate escalation and quality control in production environments.

## Advanced Legal Reasoning Capabilities

### Comprehensive Treatment Classification
The system identifies multiple types of negative treatment:
- **Strong negative treatment**: overruled, reversed, vacated, superseded, unconstitutional
- **Moderate negative treatment**: criticized, distinguished, limited in scope
- **Contextual analysis**: Considers the specific legal context and purpose of case citations

### Multi-Step Analysis Process
1. **Citation Extraction**: Systematic identification of all case references using both AI and pattern matching
2. **Context Gathering**: Analysis of surrounding text and document structure
3. **Treatment Determination**: Specialized legal reasoning about how cases are treated
4. **Quality Assessment**: Confidence scoring and human review flagging
5. **Result Synthesis**: Structured output with detailed explanations

### Production-Ready Features
- **Batch Processing**: Can handle multiple documents with consistent quality
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of agent decisions for legal defensibility
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of API failures, parsing errors, and edge cases
- **Scalability**: Designed for high-volume Discovery applications

## Model Selection and Configuration

The system uses **GPT-4o** as the primary reasoning engine, selected for:
- **Large context window** (128,000 tokens) to handle lengthy legal opinions
- **Superior reasoning capabilities** for complex legal analysis
- **Reliability** in structured output generation

The system is configured with:
- **Low temperature** (0.1) for consistent legal analysis
- **Robust error handling** for production reliability
- **Fallback strategies** when primary models are unavailable

```python
llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4o",
    temperature=0.1,  # Low temperature for consistent legal analysis
    openai_api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
)
```

## Example Applications

The system has been tested on five diverse legal opinions, with varying degrees of negative treatment representation:
- *Littlejohn v. State* (5 cases analyzed, 1 with negative treatment)
- *Beattie v. Beattie* (16 cases analyzed, 5 with negative treatment)
- *Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Lake* (6 cases analyzed, 1 with negative treatment)  
- *Tilden v. State* (9 cases analyzed, 1 with negative treatment)
- *In re Lee* (no cases found)

The system provides detailed analysis, confidence scoring, and quality control features for each case.

## Installation and Usage

### Prerequisites
```bash
pip install langchain langchain-openai langgraph pydantic beautifulsoup4 requests python-dotenv
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from agentic_negative_treatment import extract_negative_treatments_agentic

# Analyze a legal opinion
result = extract_negative_treatments_agentic('littlejohn-v-state-7')

if result:
    print(f"Found {result.total_cases_found} cases")
    print(f"Processing time: {result.processing_time:.2f}s")
    
    for treatment in result.case_treatments:
        if treatment.negative_treatment:
            print(f"{treatment.case_name}: {treatment.treatment_types}")
            print(f"Confidence: {treatment.confidence_score:.2f}")
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
# Custom workflow with specific confidence thresholds
workflow = NegativeTreatmentWorkflow(llm)
workflow.confidence_threshold = 0.85  # Higher threshold for human review

# Batch processing for Discovery applications
slugs = ['case-1', 'case-2', 'case-3']
results = [extract_negative_treatments_agentic(slug) for slug in slugs]
```
